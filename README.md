## Overview

Riverdelta is a non-monolithic Wayland compositor. It is a fork of
[river](https://codeberg.org/river/river), aimed at providing a distinct
executable name to avoid conflicts while maintaining compatibility with the
original ecosystem.

Unlike other Wayland compositors, riverdelta does not combine the compositor
and window manager into one program. Instead, users can choose any window
manager implementing the [river-window-management-v1] protocol.

Read my blog post, [Separating the Wayland Compositor and Window Manager](https://isaacfreund.com/blog/river-window-management/),
for an in-depth explanation.

There is a [list of compatible window managers](https://codeberg.org/river/wiki/src/branch/main/pages/wm-list.md)
on our [wiki](https://codeberg.org/river/wiki).

## Features

Riverdelta defers all window management policy to a separate window manager
implementing the [river-window-management-v1] protocol. This includes window
position/size, pointer/keyboard bindings, focus management, window decorations,
desktop shell graphics, and more.

Riverdelta itself provides frame perfect rendering, good performance, support for
many Wayland protocol extensions, robust Xwayland support, the ability to
hot-swap window managers, and more.

The [river-window-management-v1] protocol and other river protocol extensions
are stable.  We do not break window managers.

## Motivation

Why split the window manager to a separate process?

- Significantly lower the barrier to entry for writing a Wayland window manager.
- Allow implementing Wayland window managers in high-level garbage collected
  languages without impacting compositor performance and latency.
- Allow hot-swapping between window managers without restarting the compositor
  and all Wayland programs.
- Promote diversity and experimentation in window manager design.

## Building

Note: If you are packaging riverdelta for distribution, see [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md).

To compile riverdelta first ensure that you have the following dependencies
installed. The "development" versions are required if applicable to your
distribution.

- [zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) 0.16
- wayland
- wayland-protocols
- [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots) 0.20
- xkbcommon 1.12 or newer
- libevdev
- pixman
- pkg-config
- scdoc (optional, but required for man page generation)

Then run, for example:
```
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix ~/.local install
```
To enable Xwayland support pass the `-Dxwayland` option as well.
Run `zig build -h` to see a list of all options.

## Usage

Riverdelta can either be run nested in an X11/Wayland session or directly
from a tty using KMS/DRM. Simply run the `riverdelta` command.

On startup riverdelta will run an executable file at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/riverdelta/init`
if such an executable exists. If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set,
`~/.config/riverdelta/init` will be used instead.

Usually this executable is a shell script which starts the user's window manager
and any other long-running programs.

For complete documentation see the `riverdelta(1)` man page.
